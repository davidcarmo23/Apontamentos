# Correctness
- A program is **correct** if it is always consistent with its specification
- Depends on quality and detail of requirements
	Easy to show with respect to a weak specification
	Often impossible to prove with a detailed specification
- Correctness is rarely probably achieved

# Reliability
- Statistical approximation of correctness
- The likehood of correct behavior from some period of observed behavior
	Time Period, number of system executions
Measured relative to a specification and usage profile (expected pattern of intera)
