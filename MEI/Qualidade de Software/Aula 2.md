# Correctness
- A program is **correct** if it is always consistent with its specification
- Depends on quality and detail of requirements
	Easy to show with respect to a weak specification
	Often impossible to prove with a detailed specification
- Correctness is rarely probably achieved

# Reliability
- Statistical approximation of correctness
- The likehood of correct behavior from some period of observed behavior
	Time Period, number of system executions
- Measured relative to a specification and usage profile (expected pattern of interaction)
	Dependent on how the system is used by a type of user

# Dependence on Specifications
- Correctness and reliability
	- Success relative to the strength of the specification
		- **Hard to meaningfully prove anything for strong spec**
	- Severity of a failures
