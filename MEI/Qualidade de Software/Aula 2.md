# Correctness
A program is **correct** if it is always consistent with its specification
Depends on quality and detail of requirements
	Easy to show with respect to a weak specification
	Often impossible to prove with a detailed specification
Correctness is rarely probably achieved

# Reliability
Statistical approximation of correctness
