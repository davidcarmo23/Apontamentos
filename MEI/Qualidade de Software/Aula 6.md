## Exploratory Testing
- Testers check the system on-the-fly
	- Guided by scenarios
	- Often based on ideas noted before beginning
- Testing as a thinking idea
	- About discovery, investigation, and role-playing
	- Tests end-to-end journeys through app
	- Test design and execution done concurrently

- Tester write down ideas to give direction, then create tests "live"
	- Tester chooses next action based on results seen
- Can find subtle faults missed by formal testing
	- Allows tester to better learn system functionality, and identify new ways of using features

### Session-Based Exploratory Testing

### Session Report Items
- **Mission: Overall goal**
- **Charter: Features and scenarios to focus on**

## Automation vs Human-Driven
- Unit/System Testing heavily use automation
	- Tests written as code
	- Executed repeatedly, often on check-in
- Exploratory/Acceptance Testing often human-driven
	- Humans interact with app
	- Based on scenarios, without pre-planned input
	- Some tool support, but not often repeated exactly
